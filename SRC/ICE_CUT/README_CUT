general info about cutting surfaces using miller indices!

we need to be careful about miller indices if the cells that we use are not supercells, 
in which a, b and c have been scaled equally!!!

for Ih:
a and b need to be equal, so that (100) == (010), but not necessarily c

for Ic:
ideally a,b and c remain the same multiple...
but for 111 it is fairly easy to adjust cut in case of SC_6x4x4
