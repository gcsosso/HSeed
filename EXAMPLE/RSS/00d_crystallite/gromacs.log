Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#
Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 5.0.4 (single precision)
Using 4 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.1#

Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+01
   Number of steps    =        50000

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up confout.gro to ./#confout.gro.1#

Steepest Descents converged to Fmax < 10 in 1 steps
Potential Energy  = -2.1038199e+04
Maximum force     =  0.0000000e+00 on atom 0
Norm of force     =  0.0000000e+00
