get a .POSCAR containing the face we want to seed (e.g. Ic_SF_001_READY.POSCAR from FACES)

# VMD gets the box wrong!Cut a slice so that all water molecules are nice and whole via VMD, save it in a new POSCAR, Ic_001_T30_CUT.POSCAR
#sort them (fort. POSCAR to xyz)
# Double the title line (the first one!) just after cell dimensions in the resulting POSCAR

Clean the poscar via tidy_up_POSCAR.py, selecting the z cutoffs
tidy up: ./tidy_up_POSCAR.py Ic_001_T30.POSCAR Ic_001_T30_CLEAN.POSCAR 16 56
check number of O, H, and X. Check whether every O as Two H...
#select the right face in make_hemisphere.py (comment/scomment relevant bits)
select the desired number of layers to be considered as "lattice" in make_hemisphere.py by modyfying Z_LATTICE_CUTOFF and Z_LAYER_REMOVE. Evrything between Z_LAYER_REMOVE and Z_LATTICE_CUTOFF would be considered as lattice (stuff that changes) as opposed to seed (fixed). Play around with those two thrshhold in order to have reasonable guesses.

*try out seeds with empty cells : EMPTY_100_x_100.gro in SRC
specify the lattice file in generate_random_structure.py. e.g. seed_Ic_001.lattice
fix the cell if orthorombic
fix these parameters in the .lattice file:
- TARGET_X TARGET_Y TARGET_Z e.g. 
DISPLACE_X DISPLACE_Y DISPLACE_Z

make sure you got the face you wanted
